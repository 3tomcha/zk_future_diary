## ZK Mirai Nikki is ...
### Goal Achievement Engine with AI & Zero-Knowledge
With AI automatically creating schedules based on your goals, you simply input your objectives and follow the plan to achieve them, all while Zero-Knowledge Proofs ensure your privacy throughout the process.

---

## Key Features

- **ZKP Integration:** Leverages zk-SNARKs to securely and privately verify various data, such as location, time, and images.
- **Multi-Factor Verification:** Uses multiple axes such as location, time, and captured images to verify a single event from various perspectives.



---

## Technical Overview

- **Tech Stack:** Implemented in JavaScript with zk-SNARKs.
- **Core Functionality:** Uses cryptographic proofs to validate location-based assertions.
- **Data Flow:** User data is processed and verified through a secure cryptographic protocol.

### Future Vision

1. **Advanced Personalization**: AI will analyze real-time behavior patterns, environments, and emotional states to create even more optimized schedules tailored to individual needs.

2. **Dynamic Goal Adjustment**: With live data integration, AI will automatically adjust schedules in response to changing circumstances, making the path to goal achievement even more efficient.

3. **Complete Privacy Protection**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs will become more refined, allowing every step of the goal achievement process to be verified without revealing any personal information.

4. **Global Collaboration**: AI will facilitate optimal teamwork among multiple users by proposing schedules that protect individual privacy while enabling efficient collaboration toward shared goals.
