### Future Vision

1. **Personalized Schedules**: AI will watch your actions and surroundings in real-time to make better schedules just for you.

2. **Automatic Updates**: Just like Google Maps reroutes you when you take a different path, AI will adjust your schedule automatically to keep you on track.

3. **Teamwork Support**: AI helps the team work together. It tells you when itâ€™s your turn to start after someone else finishes, all while keeping everyone's privacy safe.
